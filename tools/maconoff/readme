to keep the state consistent some rules are obeyed

enable without mac enable the port
with mac it only add the mac 
IF the port was emtpy (no mac learned mac = 1 and admin state down) then it enable the port else the admin state stay the same

learn always enable the port 
	example why needed: else it bug with admin disabled port 2 macs 1 learned -> forget learn without mac just maxmacs++ with mac its like enable

disable without mac given set admin state on disable
disable without with mac given disable this mac on the port - admin state is kept 
	remark: if the port get empty it get disabled due to cisco software works like that - you can not set maxmacs to 0

forget without mac never disable the port just maxmacs— if not possible it fail but keep state of the port the same
forget with mac its like disable with this mac

reenable reset the port state but don’t change it states when its done

clearmacs clear all learned macs -> new can be learned depending on newmacs and admin state
